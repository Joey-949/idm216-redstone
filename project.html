            <p>The affinity map for Redstone Pizza is about what the major goals are that we need, which is efficiency. Being quick with the order should be our number 1 priority, with our persona 
                representing that, having a person who has small lunch breaks, and has to go from one place to another in a short amount of time, while also getting food.</p>

            <h2>Updated Styles and Boards</h2>
            <p>The Mood boards are an easy example on what should be the design goal of Redstone Pizza, with deep oranges and a marinara sauce like color, 
                while also having a solid color like white to balance it out. Which is prominent in our style sheet. Choosing this style of color and font that resonates with the branding of Redstone Pizza.

            Commented this out because the template only specified two images, not three.
